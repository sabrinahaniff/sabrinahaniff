### Hey everyone! My name is Sabrina and I am an 18 year old studying Computer Science at the University of Guelph and currently learning about game development using C++ and creating my own projects to work on! I have also been coding since the age of 8 and I am experienced in main languages such as Python, Java, Swift, Javascript, and C++.
